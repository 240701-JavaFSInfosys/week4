# week4

- WAHOO it's Spring week, which means we're going to learn a powerful Java framework that will power up and streamline our good old fashioned maven projects. No more Javalin for processing HTTP requests, we'll use Spring MVC instead. Best of all, NO MORE JDBC!! Spring Data will make our lives much easier when it comes to CRUD operations on our Database.
